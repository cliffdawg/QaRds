Professionals in the world need to connect and work together in order to pursue their career goals. Business cards have always been a critical part of creating connections and partnerships, but they are insubstantial, easily lost, and easily forgotten. To solve this issue, my team developed QaRds. QaRds stores business cards programmatically instead of physically. Users can generate their own business cards in the app as well as a QR code associated with it. Other users can transfer the business card to their own app by scanning the QR code. The cards have important info on them such as names, emails, websites, and occupations, and users can upload their profile picture on them. With QaRds, the simple task of swapping business info will be made greatly more efficient.
